        <img src="resources/portrait.png" height="200" align="right">
        <p>
          Hello! I am a computer science student at the University of
          Waterloo in my third year. I love computer science and math
          and have a passion for developing software that has an
          impact on other people. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I have worked as a developer of
          commercial software, but I am interested in many facets 
          of computer science. From developing games to research, 
          there is a lot more that I would like to explore.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I love creating things, and I love to learn new tools to
          help me do so. As a result, I am comfortable being put
          into situations where I have to overcome a learning curve
          in order to perform well.

          <h3>Affign</h3>
          <img src="resources/affignexample.png" height="250" align="right">
          <p>
            Affign is a desktop application that uses facial landmark
            detection to automatically align a sequence of images
            that contain a human face. It is useful for 'photo-a-day'
            projects like mine, featured below. The first version allowed users
            to run input images through Affign using an intuitive GUI that
            was implemented in wxWidgets, as pictured to the right. 
            The current version is a command line tool instead, and was
            refactored to only rely on OpenCV. The aligned
            images can be output in video or various image formats,
            ultimately producing a smoother effect. Affign makes it
            incredibly easy to align large sets of images that are
            typical in photo-a-day projects. The source code,
            release files and wiki are available on the
            <a href="https://github.com/JRKalyan/affign" title="Affign repository" target="_blank">Github page.</a>
            The project is built in C++ using OpenCV for face
            detection/landmarking and image manipulation.

          <img src="resources/inventorium.jpg" height="250" align="right">
          <p>Inventorium is my game created in under 48 hours for Ludum Dare 42 (international)
            game jam. I
            used the opportunity to do my first real project in Rust and used the ggez game
            engine. Unfortunately I had to restart on the final day and only ended up with 12
            hours to complete the game. I decided to create a simple arcade style game with
            very simple graphics due to the time constraints. I managed to finish 506th overall
            out of over 3000 submitted games, which is lower than I would have liked. I did better
            in the "theme" and "fun" categories at rank 153 and 269 respectively.
            <br />
            <br />
            The theme for the jam was "running out of space." The game consists of a simple arena
            with coins to collect for points that spawn enemies and give you ammo. Getting hit
            by an enemy or missing a shot will shrink the walls inwards until the game ends at
            zero area. Hitting enemies and getting coins increases the score, and the goal is
            to maximize your score.
            <br />
            <br />
            The experience was quite fun, and I intend to continue participating in Ludum
            Dare and other game jams in the future. The game is on GitHub with source and
            binaries available <a href="https://github.com/JRKalyan/inventorium" title="Inventorium repository" target="_blank">here.</a>

          <p>I collect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#Mechanical-switch_keyboard" target="_blank">mechanical keyboards</a>
            and also have started to build my own (pictured on the right). Mechanical
            keyboards are desired by enthusiast typists and gamers because each key is
            a separate, physical switch rather than a connected membrane of rubber domes
            that collapse on many modern keyboards. This system provides a satisfying
            experience that is ideal for fast typing because with certain switches it is
            clear exactly when a key is pressed. Mechanical keyboards tend to be more
            durable and last much longer than membrane keyboards as well.
